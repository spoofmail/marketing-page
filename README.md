--Features--

Simple & Free – Create a SpoofMail in just two easy steps. 

No Spam – Have you ever entered your email address on a random or not so random site and inexplicably start receiving emails about your car’s warranty?  With SpoofMail you no longer have to give your personal email on every site that insists that you sign up and enter a verification code before you access their content. SpoofMail stops SPAM in its tracks! 

Privacy –Internet privacy should be your concern whether you shop online, visit social networking sites, or participate in online games. Your identity could be fraudulently used or stolen if your email and/or password are compromised. SpoofMail allows you to separate important emails from spam or malicious emails, thereby reducing the chances of receiving emails that could phish or steal your information.
