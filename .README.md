##Origin
Origin of this project comes from Build Week 1 as part of WEB22 at Lambda School. 

SpoofMail Team consisted of:
Jeff Rowe - Machine Learning
Liv Johnson - Machine Learning/Data Scientist
Tisha Holder - Web UI
Eric Ferguson - Web UI
Vincent Costa - Front End
Eli Citron - Front End
Jack Ober - Backend

##Project Proposal
- What is the mission statement?

-- Providing users with convenience and anonymity.

- What problem does your app solve?

-- The problem of sharing your personal information with companies and websites that don’t have good security. Said companies could and have been hacked and in this case it wouldn’t affect you. 

- How does your app solve the problem?

-- The app would give you (either a random email every time or just one) an email for you to give to the company and would automatically verify it for you. This would give you access to the company without jeopardizing yourself.

##Features
- What features are required for MVP?

-- Provides an email. 
-- Accepts links sent to the email. 
-- Does not come back to you.

- Potential future features:

-- A list of spoofed sites for you to access or forward to your own email if you so choose.
-- A code/password that would be connected to the above list
-- ability to make our own emails ie personName@spoofmail.com

- What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?

-- Apple gives a randomly generated email
-- Loganon does the same thing but requires an email to log in
-- Mailinator keeps the fake email for a day but doesn’t fill anything out

##Target Audience

- Who is your target audience? Be specific.

-- People afraid of getting hacked. Everyone who uses the internet. People who love convenience. 

- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?

-- None to date

- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?
-- In-Progress

##Vision
Using the color theme selected by the front end team, the marketing page layout was designed to be minimalistic it look and feel for both desktop (1000px) and mobile (500px) to keep with the anonyomus nature of Spoof Mail.

Drafted on notecards html layout for both desktop and mobile to guide work. Should have spent more time doing the same for the CSS. Focus for the future is to build in more time for planning/mapping/outlinning to guide build actions and assist with attaining boarder vision quicker. 

Designing the html layout and associated css styling from scratch was fun and really pushed my ability to craft something from empty to alive. 

CSS while functional, needs cleaned up decrease repeating the same stying over and over. This will be something revisted as side work to cleanup code. 

## MVP Status

HTML/CSS: 
-- Created and implemented html and css layout plus design (no UX Designer on team). CSS code can be cleaner, a bit redundant in some places.

Responsiveness:
-- No horizontal scroll bars(!), responds to mobile view of 500px. Laying out the initial CSS for the homepage took longer than expected but I feel as if this made adjusting for mobile view easier. On the Team page, text associated with the individual's card slides out of the card.
